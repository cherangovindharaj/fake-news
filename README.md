## ðŸ“° Fake News Detector using NLP and Machine Learning

### ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project is a simple and effective **Fake News Detection system** built using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques. It classifies short news texts as **real** or **fake** based on how the language is used.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To create a Python-based application that:

* Preprocesses news headlines/articles
* Extracts features using TF-IDF
* Trains a machine learning model (Naive Bayes)
* Predicts whether new input news is real or fake

### ðŸ›  Technologies Used

| Area          | Tools                   |
| ------------- | ----------------------- |
| Language      | Python                  |
| NLP           | NLTK                    |
| ML            | scikit-learn            |
| Data Handling | pandas, numpy           |
| Model         | Multinomial Naive Bayes |
| Vectorization | TF-IDF                  |

### ðŸ§  Workflow

1. **Dataset Creation**
   A small sample dataset is used (can be expanded to real datasets like those from Kaggle).

2. **Text Preprocessing**

   * Removal of special characters
   * Conversion to lowercase
   * Stopword removal
   * Stemming using PorterStemmer

3. **Feature Extraction**
   Text is converted to numerical features using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**.

4. **Model Training**
   Trained using the **Multinomial Naive Bayes** classifier.

5. **Model Evaluation**
   Accuracy score and classification report show how well the model performs.

6. **Prediction Loop**
   A command-line loop allows users to input any news headline and get an instant prediction.

### ðŸ“ˆ Future Enhancements

* Use real-world datasets (e.g. from Kaggle)
* Build a GUI using Tkinter
* Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit
* Add deep learning models (e.g., LSTM)
* Use word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec or BERT)
